# Calendly Signup Site

A minimal, fast, GitHub Pages–ready site that promotes calendar signups via Calendly.

## Quick Start

1. **Replace your Calendly link**  
   Open `index.html` and update this value (or set it in `script.js`):

   ```html
   <script>
     window.SITE_CONFIG = {
       calendlyUrl: "https://calendly.com/your-handle/intro-call"
     };
   </script>
   ```

2. **Push to GitHub**  
   - Create a new repository, e.g. `your-handle/your-site`.
   - Upload all files in this folder to the repo root (or drag/drop).
   - Commit and push.

3. **Enable GitHub Pages**  
   - Go to **Settings → Pages**.
   - **Source**: select `Deploy from a branch`.
   - **Branch**: choose `main` (or `master`) `/ (root)` and save.
   - Your site will publish at `https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo>/`.

## Highlights Included
